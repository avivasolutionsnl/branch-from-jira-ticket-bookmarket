# branch-from-jira-ticket-bookmarket
Bookmarklet to create a feature branch from a Jira ticket

1. In Chrome, go to your Bookmarklets (chrome://bookmarks/) and add a new one.
2. Copy the code from bookmarklet-code.js into the URL field and give it a proper name.
3. When a Jira ticket is opened (in a dialog view or on the detail page), click on the Bookmarklet.
4. The code to create the branch is copied to you clipboard.
5. Go to the terminal and paste the copied code. The branch is directly created and pushed to the server.  

Of course, you can adjust the bookmarklet code to fit your needs.
